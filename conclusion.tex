\chapter{Conclusion}

The simulation solution, developed within this project was designed to reflect the IIS lab robot setup at a certain configuration.

During the scope of this bachelor project, a custom simulation solution for the IIS lab robot setup was designed, utilizing the V-Rep simulation platform. It was shown, how the simulation scene was assembled and how dynamic models of required robot components are created. The modelling process was shown on the example of the Schunk SDH2 gripper component. The resulting reference scene reflects the IIS lab robot setup at a certain configuration, but it can easily be adjusted to reflect other settings. The implemented ROS interface is not tied to a specific simulation scene but to tagged simulation models. Therefore it is easy to create additional scenes with different settings. The ROS control interfaces for the models were implemented as a V-Rep simulator plugin. The plugin is loaded on V-Rep startup and identifies known components within the currently active simulation scene. As soon as such a component is identified, it can be controlled by the proper ROS control interface. The plugin design allows to introduce additional components and extend it's functionality.

The second objective of that project was to integrate the motion planning framework MoveIt into the current setup. Therefore a URDF representation of the environment was created that exactly describes the involved robot components and their placement. Based on that URDF description, the planning framework was set up and configured. The integration process also required the implementation of an additional ROS node that allows the proper execution of time-parametrized trajectories. That node was designed to communicate with the existing ROS control interface and can be configured to interact with the simulator and the real robot as well. Finally, the proper functionality of the planning tools and the simulator was shown on a reference \emph{pick and place} task that can be executed on both instances.
