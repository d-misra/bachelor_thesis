\chapter{Observations}

\subsection{Test results, measurements, accuracy\ldots}
I'd like to do some measurements about the accuracy of the calculated trajectories, maybe using different planning algorithms and present the outcome here, also the results of the IK-functionality tests.

\subsection{Problems}
When occur accidental hits, what other problems did I face during testing?
