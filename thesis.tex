\chapternn{Abstract}
The first part of this thesis describes the design and implementation of a custom simulation solution for the robot setup in the IIS Lab. It describes the necessary modelling steps for the resulting simulation models and the implementation of a proper control interface based on the Robot Operating System (ROS). The resulting solution provides the same control interface as the real robot and can therefore be used to test high-level control code on the simulator before utilizing it on the real robot. Therefore it was necessary to determine the volumetric, kinematic and dynamic properties of the involved robot components and their exact placement relative to each other. The second part describes the integration of the motion planning framework MoveIt into the existing setup. The aim of this framework is to plan and execute complex robot motions without colliding with the environment. The proper functioning of the planning tools and the simulator is then shown on the example of a benchmark pick and place task that is planned and executed on the simulator and the real robot as well.
